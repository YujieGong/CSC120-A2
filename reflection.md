What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Through looking at the output of my code, My output is the same as that of the procedural code before, so I think it works properly. But one thing I'm not very sure is how to test it, because I only compare the output, but I don't if my code will work and output accordingly if the computer is not in the inventory. One advice would be working with a classmate you know. As I first started doing this assignment, I was really confused so I discussed with Zhirou and we tried to figure about how to change from procedural coding to object-oriented coding. Another advice is to review the codes in class and relate it with the assignment, that would be really helpful.
